# Undergraduate thesis 

This project aimed to create a machine learning model for predicting student text grades, using natural language processing techniques and word vectorization algorithms, such as BERT, word embedding, bag of words, TF-IDF to use as input on algorithms like linear regression and support vector machine. Ontologies were also employed to assist in the effectiveness of the algorithms by giving an human-like context to those texts. Also was applied techniques like part of speech tagging, named entity recognition to tests how adding those parameters impact the result of the model, and also tuning the hyper parameters. At the end was compared all those models to check what was the most effective.
